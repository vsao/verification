# LVS User Manual
## Overview  
The Calibre Verification applications operate on rule files written in Standard Verification Rule Format(SVRF) or TCL verification Format(TVF).

## LVS Data Flow  
![LVS FLOW](https://github.com/vsao/verification/blob/main/Rule_deck/lvs_flow.png?raw=true)

## Tool Invocation
Calibre nmDRC and Calibre nmLVS require rule file and design database inputs in certain formats in order to perform verification tasks. There are certain files that needed before invoking Calibre Physical Verification tool:
1. Rule File
2. Layout Databases
3. Source Databases 

### Rule File
It is a tandard Verification Rule Format (SVRF) or Tcl Verification Format(TVF) form. Rule files contain two main categories of commands:  
1. Specification statements: Such as describing the layout and source databases, and specifying where to store the results of a run.
2. Layer operations: manipulation of layers through Boolean operations, measurement operations etc.  

### Layout Databases
The layout database must be one of the system formats: GDSII, OASIS, LEFDEF, MIlKYWAY, ASCII, Binary, SPICE, CNET

In SPICE Format for Layout, Calibre nmLVS-H netlist-to-netlist comparison uses a SPICE or HSPICE netlist for the layout.
In CNET Format for Layout, CNET stands for Compiled NETlist, a proprietary Mentor Graphics netlist format. This database type can be used for the layout in flat LVS comparison.

### Source Databases
A source database contains circuit information such as schematic netlist or source netlist. The source file is compared to the layout during an LVS run.

### Calibre nmLVS and Calibre nmLVS-H Command Line
- General Command 
```bash
calibre [ -lvs [ [ { -tl || -ts } cnet_file_name ][ -nonames ] [ -cell ][ -dblayers "name1,..." ][ -bpf [ no-extents ] ] [ -nl ] [ -cb ]] || [ -hier [ -automatch || -genhcells[=qs_tcl_file_name] ] || -flatten][ -ixf ] [ -nxf ]]
```
- Spice extraction using command line 
```bash
calibre -spice cellname.sp rulefile
```
- For an example spice extraction of poly-resistor(rnp1) is shown below:  
```bash
/CAD/mentor/calibre/2020-2-14-12/aoi_cal_2020.2_14.12/bin/calibre -spice my_resister.sp _xt018_1243_
 ```
-   ``/CAD/mentor/calibre/2020-2-14-12/aoi_cal_2020.2_14.12/bin/calibre`` is the path of calibre executable file.
-   ``-spice`` command extracts spice netlist from layout file.
-   ``my_resister.sp`` is the name of the extracted spice file.
-   ``_xt018_1243_`` is the rule file.  

- spice file of the layout is generated by running the above command(my_register.sp): 
```bash
.SUBCKT my_resistor t2 t1  
** N=4 EP=2 IP=0 FDC=1  
R0 t2 t1 L=1e-05 W=2e-06 $[rnp1] $X=-1525 $Y=-1025 $D=122  
.ENDS  
 ```
- lvs comparison using command line
```bash
calibre -lvs -hier rulefile
```
- For an example lvs comparison of poly-register(rnp1) is shown below:  
```bash
/CAD/mentor/calibre/2020-2-14-12/aoi_cal_2020.2_14.12/bin/calibre -lvs -hier _xt018_1243_
```
- ``/CAD/mentor/calibre/2020-2-14-12/aoi_cal_2020.2_14.12/bin/calibre`` is the path of the calibre executable file.
- ``-lvs`` command performs the lvs comaprison between spice netlists of schematic and layout.
- ``-hier`` command performs herarchical lvs comparision.
- ``_xt018_1243_`` is the rule file.  

- Both spice extraction and lvs comparison can be done using a single command
```bash
/CAD/mentor/calibre/2020-2-14-12/aoi_cal_2020.2_14.12/bin/calibre -spice my_resister.sp -lvs -hier -nowait _xt018_1243_
```
